            This document outlines the identified concepts required to justify the exercising of data subject's rights,
            including justifications to delay or not fulfil such rights.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>The motivation for this work is derived from the need to create and maintain records of the exercising
        of data subject's rights under the GDPR.
        This work was developed (and is already integrated) within the context of the DPVCG and was started with 
        the main objectives of indicating</p>
        <ul>
            <li>what rights exist</li>
            <li>where such rights can be exercised</li>
            <li>what information needs to be recorded and maintained when a concrete instance of a right is being/was exercise</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As such, the flows of information between a data subject and a data controller for the
            exercising of a right request, according to the GDPR, were analysed to extract the relevant concepts to be recorded.
            <a href="#DSR">Figure 1</a> illustrates these flows.
        </p>
        <p>
            After sending a notice to the data subject
            confirming that the request was received, the controller must be able to identify the data subject in
            order to proceed with the request (Article 12.2, second sentence). If the controller cannot
            identify the data subject, then the data subject must provide additional information to enable the
            controller to identify them (Article 11.2). If the controller disregards the request or has
            a justification for not fulfilling the right, then the data subject does not receive any information
            related to the right request (Article 12.2, second sentence). In case the controller has
            a justification to delay the request due to its complexity or a high number of requests, then
            the controller has a 2-month extension to fulfil its duty (Article 12.3, second sentence).
            Moreover, in case the request is unfounded or excessive, the controller can charge a fee and the
            data subject will get the information once this fee is paid (Article 12.5, first sentence). As
            it is visible by the diagram, at any point if the data controller does not fulfil its duty then a GDPR
            breach occurs and the data subject does not receive their requested information.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            As will be explored in the next section, from the analysis of these flows of information,
            a set of high-level concepts was proposed and adopted by the 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/dpvcg/" target="_blank">DPVCG</a> 
            (general concepts on Rights are modelled in the main DPV specification at
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv#vocab-rights" target="_blank">https://w3id.org/dpv#vocab-rights</a> 
            and GDPR-specific ones in the GDPR extension at 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#vocab-rights" target="_blank">https://w3id.org/dpv/legal/eu/gdpr#vocab-rights</a>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Missing from these set of initial concepts adopted by the CG were terms to justify the fulfillment, non-fulfillment and 
            delay in rights exercising. These shall be the main contribution presented in this document.

    <section id="concepts">
        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            This section highlights the concepts defined in DPV for the expression of information related to the exercising of data subject rights.
            In particular, 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#base">Base concepts</a> refer to the concepts already defined in DPV for associating rights with notices, 
                right exercise activities and records, as well as request status.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#justifications">Justifications</a> refer to a collection of generic justification concepts for the the non-fulfillment, 
                delay of fulfillment and exercise of rights, which can be provided in a DPV justifications extension, based on GDPR clauses.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="base">Base concepts</h3>
        <figure>
            <img id="rights" src="https://w3c.github.io/dpv/1.0/diagrams/rights.png" alt="Core concepts of DPV's rights taxonomy" width="100%">
            <figcaption>Core concepts of DPV's rights taxonomy</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Beyond modelling concepts for applicable <code>Right</code>s and <code>DataSubjectRight</code>s, to indicate the association of concepts 
            with a particular right, the <code>hasRight</code> property is also modelled in <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv" target="_blank">DPV</a>.
            Additionally, to make a distinction between actionable and non-actionable rights, the <code>ActiveRight</code> and <code>PassiveRight</code>
            concepts were created to distinguish between rights that require an action to be taken for them to be exercised and rights that don't require 
            any action and are always applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>isExercisedAt</code> property should be used to connect a right with a <code>RightExerciseNotice</code>.
            This notice provides contextual information regarding how to exercise a right.
            Specialised notice concepts for rights that can be fulfilled and those that cannot are modelled as <code>RightFulfilmentNotice</code> and 
            <code>RightNonFulfilmentNotice</code>, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            To represent concrete records of rights being exercised, the <code>RightExerciseRecord</code> concept can be used to associate a particular 
            request, or even distinct requests from the same data subject, with corresponding rights exercising activities, modelled as 
            <code>RightExerciseActivity</code>, using the 
            <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata Terms</a> <code>hasPart</code> property.
            Additionally, to track the status of rights exercising activities, a set of request statuses are modelled in 
            <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv" target="_blank">DPV</a>, including <code>RequestAccepted</code> for a request being accepted towards fulfilment, 
            <code>RequestRejected</code> for a request being rejected towards non-fulfilment or <code>RequestRequiresAction</code> for a request requiring 
            an action to be performed from another party.
            <a href="#status">Figure 3</a> showcases the lifecycle of the request status 
            defined in DPV.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Request status cycle to track the status of rights exercising activities.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            While this modelling was inspired by the GDPR, the concepts are described in a jurisdiction-agnostic manner so that they can be used to tackle 
            data protection regulations in different jurisdictions.
        </p>

        <h3 id="justifications">Justifications</h3>

        </figure>
        <p>
            A collection of justifications for the non-fulfillment, delay of fulfillment and exercise of rights were modelled as subclasses of the 
            <code>NonPerformanceJustification</code>, <code>DelayJustification</code> and <code>ExerciseJustification</code> concepts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>NonPerformanceJustification</code>: Justification to reject or not complete a process</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>NotRequiredJustification</code>: JJustification to reject or not complete a process as it does not apply</li>
                <li><code>RightNonFulfilmentJustification</code>: Justification to reject or not complete a right exercising activity</li>
            </ul>
            <li><code>DelayJustification</code>: Justification to delay a process</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>RightFulfilmentDelayJustification</code>: Justification to delay a right exercising activity</li>
            </ul>
            <li><code>ExerciseJustification</code>: Justification to exercise or iniciate a process</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>RightExerciseJustification</code>: Justification to exercise or iniciate a right exercising activity</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>The modelled concepts for each type of justification are defined below and the used GDPR clause is also introduced.</p>

        <p>The following set of concepts can be used to reject a certain process or activity (<code>NotRequiredJustification</code>):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>JNotReq-TOMSafeguard</code>: Justification that the process is not required as it is safeguarded by appropriate technical and organisational measures <b>[Art.34-3-a GDPR]</b></li>
            <li><code>JNotReq-UnlikelyRightsImpact</code>: Justification that the process is not required as it is considered to be an unlikely impact on rights and freedoms <b>[Art.A34-3-b GDPR]</b></li>
            <li><code>JNotReq-DisproportionateEffort</code>: Justification that the process is not required as it would require a disproportionate effort <b>[Art.34-3-c GDPR]</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The following set of concepts can be used to express generic justifications for the non-fulfillment of rights exercising (<code>RightNonFulfilmentJustification</code>):</p>

                This is an example of a right exercise activity recording the justification on why a data subject
                access request was rejected. In this case, the justification was due to a failure in the 
                verification of the identity of the data subject.
